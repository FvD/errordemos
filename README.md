# API with Error Demo's

Demo of error reporting using googleErrorReportingR


## Stop demo

Errors that we typically catch with a stop, only we now put the report before the actual stop so that we can see it happened.


## tryCatch demo

Typical trycatch setup but now sending out `e` as an error report.


## 500 demo

Can we catch unexpected error with R?
